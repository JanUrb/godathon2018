# HACKATHON 2018

web-based voip app with javascript, html5 and go.

## Project structure

The project includes the project voipathon (a fork for now) as submodule. Make sure you pull the submodule as well (git submodule foreach git pull origin master)

## Nature of a group

For now, a user can only be attached to one group and a call can only be in one group.
